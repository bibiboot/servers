Mutex and Semphore
Mutex can be released only by thread that had acquired it, while you can signal semaphore from any other thread (or process), so semaphores are more suitable for some synchronization problems like producer-consumer.

Guarded Commends for threads
pthread_cond_wait to be called only when locked is acquired.
It unlocks mutex if the condition is not true and when signalled it acquies the mutex automatically.
pthread_cond_broadcast to be called only if you have the mutex.

ErrorNo
errno now is a macro which calls a thread specific function. Hence thread safe.

Signal
Software interrupt
SIGUSR1 are user defined functions.
SIGUSR2 are user defined functions.
SIGKILL generated by kill unix command. Polite way to say to kill themselves. Can be blocked.
SIGINT is CTRL+C
SIGKILL cannot be ignored and is generated to kill ASAP.
SIGALRM when you need the functionality of a timer.
SIGCHLD when the child is finished and it sends signal to the parent.
kill(int signal, pid_t pid) send signal to a specific process.
pthread_kill send signal to a specific thread.
signal(SIGINT, SIG_IGN) to ignore a signal.
A signal is delivered to a random thread.
